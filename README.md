# ZooSeeker App

I developed an app that displays directions for navigating the San Diego Zoo. I brought together algorithms and design patterns from a variety of courses to form a cohesive app for this project. I organized and designed the app from start to finish using Github and Git for version control as well as Zenhub for agile project management.
